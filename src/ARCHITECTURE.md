# Project Architecture

## Overview
This document outlines the architectural design of the Battle.meme platform.

## Core Components

### Frontend
- React.js for UI components
- Redux for state management
- Socket.IO client for real-time features
- IPFS integration for meme storage

### Backend
- Node.js with Express
- Socket.IO for real-time communication
- MongoDB for data persistence
- Redis for caching and session management

## System Design

### Authentication Flow
1. User registration/login
2. JWT token generation
3. Session management with Redis

### Game Logic
1. Match-making system
2. Real-time battle mechanics
3. Scoring and ranking system

### Data Flow
1. Client-server communication
2. Database interactions
3. Caching strategy

## Security Considerations
- Input validation
- Rate limiting
- Data encryption
- Secure session management

## Performance Optimization
- Caching strategy
- Database indexing
- Load balancing
- Content delivery optimization
